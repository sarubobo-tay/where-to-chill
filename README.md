## About The Project

A Full stack web application built to find the best places to grab drinks across Singapore. 
It is built using the regional database pulled through the Yelp API.
The focus of this project is for me to learn basic web application development by adding the following capabilities.
1. CRUD operations
2. Manual web styling
3. Authentication and Authorization
4. Simple Features (Registration, Reviews etc.)
